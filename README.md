# Admixture_Wrapper

This script aims to simplify the setup for ADMIXTURE cross-validation scheme
for choosing the best K.

# Prerequisites

R version > 4.
Make sure that `plink` (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/) and admixture32 (https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/download.html) are in the $PATH. 

I was experiencing weird errors with the 64bit ADMIXTURE binary, so I switched to the 32bit version.

Make sure that R has access to said $PATH.
